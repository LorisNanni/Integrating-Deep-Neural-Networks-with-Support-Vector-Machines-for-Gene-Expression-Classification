# Integrating Deep Neural Networks with Support Vector Machines for Gene Expression Classification

both datasets and split training/test sets are available at: https://zenodo.org/records/17993056
code/toolbox LibSVM is avaialble at: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/

This repository contains code and tools for pan-cancer data classification using deep learning architectures, SVM, and feature selection techniques. It includes preprocessing pipelines, channel expansion, neural network models, model comparison, and results analysis.

`py/ensemble` contains feature selection (with Chi2 and Random Forest) and classification (with SVM, MLP, CNN-1D, BaseKAN, EfficientKAN, FourierKAN, IT-KAN, DI-CNN+).

`py/fc_kan` contains the Fully Connected KAN classification pipeline.

`R/HMCC` contains the HMCC feature selection and classification pipeline.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Raw, processed, and split datasets.

    - `main.py` – Orchestrates end-to-end experiments: loads `configs.yaml` and datasets, sets up results and logs, runs cross-validated evaluation per dataset, and saves aggregated logits, metrics, ROC plots, and summary charts.
    - `configs.yaml` – Specifies datasets, feature counts, and per-model hyperparameters.
    - `run_seeds.sh` — Script that runs `main.py` for one or more seeds passed after -s (e.g., bash run_seeds.sh -s 42 1000 12345)
  - `fc_kan/` – Fully Connected KAN classification pipeline. SE
- `R/` – R-based classifiers.
  - `renv.lock` – renv environment snapshot.
  - `HMCC/` – Ensemble feature selection and classification (Rahaman et al., 2025; [doi:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110687](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110687)).
    - `feature_selection.r` – HMCC ensemble feature-selection implementation.
    - `classification.r` – Classification pipeline using HMCC-selected features; supports SVM and Random Forest.

| `{seed}` | Random seed passed via `--seed` (default: `42`) |
| `{mode}` | FC KAN feature mode (`10k` or `30`) |

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12** – See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt); PyTorch and Torchvision must be installed separately.
- **R 4.5.2** – See [renv.lock](R/renv.lock).

## Python Setup - for Ensemble and FC_KAN

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3.12 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install PyTorch (2.12.0) and Torchvision (0.27.0) for your OS and CUDA configuration via the [official PyTorch installer](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

3. Install remaining dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Ensemble - Usage
```sh
cd py/ensemble/
python main.py
```

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |

| `-c, --configs` | str | `configs.yaml` | Path to YAML config file (datasets, feature counts, models). |
| `-f, --input_output_folder` | str | `../../` | Base project folder containing `data/`; results are saved here. |
| `-s, --seed` | int | `42` | Random seed for reproducibility; used by Random Forest during feature selection and by classification methods. |

### Run experiments with multiple seeds
To run experiments for a custom list of seeds, pass them after `-s`:
```sh
cd py/ensemble/
bash run_seeds.sh -s 42 1000 12345
```

### Results

Results are saved to `{input_output_folder}/results/Ensemble_{n_features}_s{seed}_{timestamp}/`.

## HMCC
**Paper:** Rahaman et al. · [doi:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110687](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110687)  
**Repository:** [BandhanSarker/HMCC](https://github.com/BandhanSarker/HMCC)  

Feature selection combines LIMMA, SAM, ANOVA, KW-test, and t-test; classification uses Random Forest. On TCGA datasets the t-test is not functional.

### Setup and Usage
```sh
Rscript --vanilla -e "install.packages('renv', repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org')"
Rscript -e "renv::init(bare = TRUE); renv::restore(lockfile = 'R/renv.lock')"
Rscript R/HMCC/classification.r
```

### Results
A folder named `HMCC_{timestamp}` is created inside `results/`.

Structure:
- `logits/`
  - `{dataset}/`
      - `RF`
        - `fold_{fold}.txt`
      - `SVMR`
        - `fold_{fold}.txt`
- `selected_features/`
  - `{dataset}`
    - `selected_features_{fold}.txt` - 0 indexed
